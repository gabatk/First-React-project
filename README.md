Exercise: Passing Data via "props"
You're working on the UI prototype for an online shop and your task is to output two product items (via the <Product /> component you find in the Product.js file) below the main page title ("My Demo Shop") in the App component.

The final UI should look like this:

The two product items should use the same component (<Product />) but output different data (title, price & description). Data should be passed to the components (and output there) via props.

The first product item is expected to display the following information:

Title: Product 1

Price: 10

Description: First product

The second product item is expected to display the following information:

Title: Product 2

Price: 20

Description: Second product
